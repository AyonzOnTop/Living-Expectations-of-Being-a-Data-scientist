# Living-expectation-of-being-a-Data-scientist
**Installation**

The code was written in Python 3 and requires the following packages: Pandas, Numpy, Collections, Matplotlib and Seaborn

*Project Motivation*
The motivation behind this analysis is to explore the living expectation in being a Data scientist. Consequently, in this analysis, I set out to answer the following questions, using data collected by Stack Overflow as part of their 2018 Annual Developer Survey:

-What is the lifestyle of a typical datascientist?
-How satisfied are datascientist with their jobs compared to other kind  developers?
-How much do Data scientist from Africa earn annually?

File Descriptions
All analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook DS Survey Analysis.ipynb.

To run this code, it is first necessary to download the 2018 Stack Overflow Develop Survey dataset from https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey. The folder containing this data (developer_survey_2018) should then be saved in the current working directory in a folder named "Data".

Results
The main findings of this analysis are summarised in a blog post available here.
